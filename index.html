    <p>The difference between var and let includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Var can be redeclared while let cannot</li>
            <li>Var is function scoped and let is block scope</li>
            <li>var is not ES2015 and let is</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        Hoisting is how we explain the complier. Variables are lifted to the top of the scope they are declared in. Functions work in a similar way and can be called before they are defined in a codebase if they are defined further down.
